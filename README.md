# OBS Stream Scheduler

This app allows you to schedule start streaming and stop streaming times for OBS.

### **NOTE:** This version is for **OBS v27** and lower and **obs-websocket 4.9** and lower

This was because I used an older computer (macOS 10.13)

## Requirements

  - anything above would'nt work on my system

- install "obs-websocket" v4.9 or lower
  - needs to be used with OBS v27

- install "node.js" v16 or lower
  - version 16 worked for MacOS 10.13

## Setup:

- Clone this repositiory into VScode (or your IDE)

  - in your terminal use: `npm i`

- change dates in the `config.json` file
